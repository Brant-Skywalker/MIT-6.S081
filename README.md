# MIT 6.S081: Operating System Engineering

This repository contains my solutions to the lab assignments of MIT
[*6.S081: Operating System Engineering*](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2021/schedule.html). If you find any errors, please
email me at siyuanq4@illinois.edu.

### Important Information

**Please Note**: Lab assignments in this repository are **Fall 2021** version by default (except lab `lazy`, which **does not exist**
in [Fall 2021 schedule](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2021/schedule.html)). However, they are completed in the order specified
in [Fall 2020 schedule](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2020/schedule.html).

Unfortunately, I'm not an MIT student! :wink: Lab assignments will be marked complete below only after the *entire* test scripts have been
passed, unless explicitly stated. Let's enjoy these labs *slowly but thoroughly* while studying UCB CS162 concurrently. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
