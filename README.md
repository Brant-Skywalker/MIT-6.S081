# MIT 6.S081: Operating System Engineering

This repository contains my solutions to the lab assignments of MIT
[*6.S081: Operating System Engineering*](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2020/schedule.html)
(Fall 2020). If you find any errors, please
email me at siyuanq4@illinois.edu.

### Important Information

Unfortunately, I'm not an MIT student! :wink: Lab assignments will be marked complete below only after the *entire* test scripts have been
passed, unless explicitly stated. Let's enjoy these labs *slowly but thoroughly* while studying UCB CS162 concurrently. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
